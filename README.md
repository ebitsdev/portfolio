# Portfolio site for Google Udcaity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree
This portfolio site is my first project for my Google Udacity Nanodegree scholarship.

The project requirements are as follow:

1. Create a site with featured work in front-end development
2. Use Flexbox, bootstrap, foundation to create a responsive grid layout
3. Use semantic HTML5 elements such as header, aside, article, etc.
4. Use CSS (Sass) for styling.

The finished site is located at [portfolio](https://ebitsdev.github.io/portfolio)
